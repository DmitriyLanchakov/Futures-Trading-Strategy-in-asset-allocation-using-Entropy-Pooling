Futures-Trading
===============
The codes in this file include futures trading strategy designed by myself in course MATH 4073:Quant Methods in Investment Management course under Columbia University Masters program in Mathematics of Finance. It is one-semester based project and counts 100% for this course. 
I designed both trading folloiwng and mean reversion strategies for 26 futures contract, which gives 52 pnl series. Our group use these pnls series to plug into our Entropy Pooling approch to optimize our portfolio.
The portfolio_performance.R file contains the final results of our portfolio given the weights from Entropy Pooling approach.
